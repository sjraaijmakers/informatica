ARM is a family of instruction set architectures for computer
processors based on a reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
architecture developed by British company ARM Holdings.

A RISC-based computer design approach means ARM processors require
significantly fewer transistors than typical CISC processors in
most personal computers. This approach reduces costs, heat and power
use. Such reductions are desirable traits for light, portable,
battery-powered devices including smartphones, laptops, tablet
and notepad computers, and other embedded systems. A simpler design
facilitates more efficient multi-core CPUs and higher core counts at
lower cost, providing improved energy efficiency for servers.
