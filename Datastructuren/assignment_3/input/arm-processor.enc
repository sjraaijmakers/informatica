ARM* is* a* family* of* instruction* set* architectures* for* computer*
processors* based* on 9 reduced* 7 6 computing* (RISC)
architecture* developed* by British company 15 Holdings.

A RISC-based* 7 design approach means 16 6 require
significantly* fewer transistors than typical CISC 7 in
most personal computers. This approach* reduces costs, heat and power
use. Such reductions are desirable traits 10 light, portable,
battery-powered* devices including smartphones, laptops, tablet
and* notepad computers*, 1 other embedded systems. A simpler design*
facilitates more efficient multi-core CPUs 2 higher core counts at
lower cost, providing improved energy efficiency 14 servers.
